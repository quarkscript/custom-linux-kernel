Build a custom arch linux kernel for my old pc.

I don't actually know is it run faster or slower than a generic kernel, is it cause of optimizations or config, I hope it is faster.

Kernel config will be created automatically for local hw and some drivers will be forced on from template.

Next picture a little bit outdated. Linux kernels builded from recent versions (with and without forced gcc optimizations flags) has a smaller difference in performance.
